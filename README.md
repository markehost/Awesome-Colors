Awesome Colors  
===============

Colors borrowed from Pantone and the Fashion infustry to provide some real-world inspiration to the digital screen.  

I'm leaving out many of the colors because they just don't fit my style or may not translate whell to a bright screen, though, I may add them later to be thorough.

Future plans for these colors is to create a web app to easily browse and copy colors to clipboard.  You can always use Adobe Kuler to adjust the color so I'm just looking to provide an area of industry stadard inspiration, not an all inclusive tool for creating colors.
